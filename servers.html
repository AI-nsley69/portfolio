            <h3>Homelab</h3>
            <p>My homelab is a HP DL380P Generation 8 server powered by 2x Intel Xeon E5-2680 and 32GB DDR3 ECC.
                Due to some issues with the consumer harddrives on it, the iLO firmware is hacked to allow for fancontrol
                through a <a href="https://github.com/AI-nsley69/siLO">script</a> I made myself to keep the fans low due to the environment it is in. 
                Powered by Proxmox as the Operating System, it is using LXC to containerize as many services as possible, with all containers
                running in their own subnet behind <a href="https://www.pfsense.org/">pfsense</a>. This lets me tighten the forwarding rules, 
                use vpn as gateways for certain services that I do not want the request to come from my public ip, scanning packets to prevent any 
                intrustion attacks with <a href="https://www.snort.org/">Snort</a> & <a href="http://www.squid-cache.org/">Squid Proxy</a> to cache requests
                and scan downloads for malicious content with <a href="https://www.clamav.net/">ClamAV</a>.
                The services are not exposed directly, but through a reverse proxy done with <a href="https://caddyserver.com/">Caddy</a> 
                for automatic SSL certificates and using multiple services with one port (443 specifically) through subdomains. 
                Some services include my own git server with the <a href="https://gitea.io/en-us/">Gitea</a> application, 
                my own Bitwarden instance with <a href="https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden">Vaultwarden</a> as the implementation for the backend, 
                <a href="https://jellyfin.org/">Jellyfin</a> as a media for all of my media needs, 
                <a href="https://jellyfin.org/">Jenkins</a> as build server to compile my own software and other self-hosted software like Vaultwarden 
                and my own wiki with <a href="https://js.wiki/">Wiki.js</a> to document the majority of things I do and how I setup stuff.
