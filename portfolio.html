                <h3><a href="https://github.com/KhaosMC/khaos-utils">Khaos Utils</a></h3>
                <p>
                    A Discord Bot written in Node.js to serve the community of a Technical Minecraft Server
                    managed by me. Features include application management 
                    (creating valid application links through secrets, setting up polls for apps, creating a channel for the applicant etc),
                    communicating with the Minecraft servers (gathering status on proxy & the 3 minecraft servers and bridging all of the chats together with a websocket server and server-side mods)
                    moderation commands (kick, ban, mute etc), & more!
                </p>
                <h3><a href="https://github.com/AI-nsley69/imbed">imbed</a></h3>
                <p>
                    A small program to embed any data into an image written in Zig. It is achieved through
                    appending the data after the JPG header to end the image, this causes no corruption/change in the image aside from its storage size. 
                    Currently requires some finicky methods to embed anything other than a txt file
                    (i.e rename file to message.txt, embed that then when reversing the process revert the name). 
                    Encrypts the data through XSalsa20Poly1305 through user input password.

                <p>
                    A small program written in Python to gather all of the fabric mods from a current mc version 
                    and downloading them into a single directory. Created as a joke in response to a modpack known as All Of Fabric 
                    which is not literal. However, this program is!

                <p>
                    A small space invaders-like game created in C# with the MonoGame framework as a school assignment.

                <h3><a href="https://github.com/KismetNetwork/Luckperms-Group-Whitelist">Luckperms Group Whitelist</a></h3>
                <p>
                    A small <a href="https://velocitypowered.com">Velocity</a> plugin in Java, which depends on a permission-based plugin
                    to only allow certain groups to join specific servers on the proxy. 
                    Created with the intention of using it on Minecraft networks to minimize the needed server-side mods & 
                    manual management for whitelist.
